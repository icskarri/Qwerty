Qwerty is a tool for generating various analyses on unstructured text data. The text analysis and tool itself are both built with R and Shiny, leveraging various external libraries. The tool has functionality to upload a txt file, where it will then be processed into a structured format and broken down into individual tokens, making it possible to generate various graphs for sentiment analysis, bi-gram analysis, word correlations, and topic modeling. A distinct advantage of Qwerty is its forkability - with knowledge of the basics of the core Tidyverse libraries and approach to writing R code, a developer could modify this project with a different series of visuals or additional functionality, adapting it to their specific needs with relative ease.
