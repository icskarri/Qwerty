                               PREFACE.\
\
\
The object of the following pages is to bring under one head the\
information that is scattered through Despatches, Army Lists, Gazettes,\
Books, Magazines, &c. concerning the History of the different Regiments\
of the British Army; and to enable anyone at a glance to ascertain\
whether a certain Regiment served during a certain campaign, or was at\
a certain action, or what its Title or Uniform was at a certain date.\
\
The histories of many Regiments have been published separately, some\
by authority, and a few through, and by, the _esprit de corps_ of\
some officer, but this is intended to show every existing Regiment\'92s\
services, &c. in a small space, in a condensed form, and in one volume.\
\
Since the year 1870, much has been seen, and more heard, about\
organization and localization, but we have also seen the Regiments\
(which were the admiration of soldiers of every country in Europe),\
\'93meddled and muddled\'94 with till they are only a wretched likeness of\
what they were.\
\
We have seen _esprit de corps_ sapped to its foundations, and\
attempted to be destroyed by the abolition of every Regimental\
tradition, badge, and even button, that our civilian Army reformers\
could do away with.\
\
Where are the old Regimental officers who were proud to serve the Crown\
for _nothing_?\
\
Where are the magnificent old non-commissioned officers and men that\
would follow their officers wherever they led?\
\
What is the answer?\
\
The officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, have all but\
disappeared, and the ranks are filled by over-educated boys, who\
consequently think they are as competent to lead their comrades as\
their officers.\
\
Moreover, we now see all ranks looking forward to the time when they\
shall be turned out of the Regiment, instead of, as formerly, looking\
on it as their home for the best part of their lives.\
\
Then, as another blow to the old constitution of Regiments, and a\
reduction of their fighting power, we have the new \'93Brigade Dep\'f4ts,\'94\
and \'93Linked Battalions.\'94\
\
Do not the pages of the Army List, with this last heading, betray the\
fact that the Regiments must have been \'93linked\'94 together by some one\
who was incompetent to do so?\
\
Take the 27th Inniskilling, a Regiment essentially Irish in its\
character and composition, \'93linked\'94 to the 108th Madras Infantry. What\
connection the person entrusted with a matter of such vital importance\
could see in these two Regiments is quite beyond the imagination of a\
soldier, and gives rise to the idea that he must have drawn them out of\
a hat. The 27th has a glorious history of two centuries; the 108th was\
only raised by the East India Company in 1854, and has no more to do\
with Ireland than the Russian Guards.\
\
Look at the 31st Huntingdonshire and the 70th Surrey \'93linked\'94 together\
at Kingston. Is every Huntingdonshire man who wishes to join his county\
Regiment to walk all the way to Kingston to enlist? and when he does\
so, be uncertain whether he is to wear the Huntingdon buff or the\
Surrey black?\
\
Had only the dep\'f4t of the 35th Royal Sussex been localized at\
Chichester to obtain recruits for that regiment, it would have been\
perfect; as it is, the \'93Brigade Dep\'f4t\'94 at that city is partly formed of\
two nominal companies of the 107th Bengal Infantry, which Regiment of\
course never had the slightest connection with the county of Sussex.\
\
The two dep\'f4ts, or four nominal companies, form the \'9343rd Brigade\
Dep\'f4t.\'94 It surely might have been numbered the \'9335th Brigade Dep\'f4t,\'94\
and so have kept up a semblance of the old county number.\
\
It follows, therefore, that a man of Sussex wishing to enlist in his\
county Regiment, first has to go into the \'9343rd Brigade Dep\'f4t,\'94 and\
then may find himself in the 107th Bengal Infantry, which Regiment he\
never intended to serve in at all!\
\
But the above examples of ill-matched couples will suffice.\
\
Is it wonderful that soldiers with the least gleam of _esprit de\
corps_ desert?\
\
The fact is, that the glorious old Regiments of the British Army are\
in process of being improved off the face of the martial world, and if\
the system of \'93Brigade Dep\'f4ts\'94 is persevered in, the Regiment must\
eventually disappear.\
\
Let anyone read the \'93General Order\'94 of the 17th March 1873. It says--\
\
\'93The single Battalion Regiments, which are linked together to form the\
Line portion of a sub-district Brigade, will, so far as regards the\
Sub-Lieutenants thereto appointed, and the soldiers therein enlisted,\
after the date of this order, _constitute one corps_ for all\
military purposes.\
\
\'93All first appointments to the Line, and all enlistments for Line\
service, will be for the particular Brigade, _instead of as\
heretofore, for particular Regiments_.\'94\
\
\'93The officers and soldiers who may be so appointed to any Brigade,\
will, for relief, for all duties at home and abroad, and for every\
military purpose whatsoever, _and in whatever ranks they may\
thereafter respectively hold, be interchangeable between the Line\
Battalions of their Brigade, and will be liable to serve in either\
of those Battalions indifferently, without regard to the particular\
Battalion to which they may have been first appointed to serve_.\'94\
\
There rang the death-knell of the old Regiments of the British Army!\
\
Can anything be more conclusive, or more depressing to a soldier?\
\
Is it calculated to foster that pride in, and love for, his own\
particular Regiment that every true soldier who has worn its uniform\
has for it?\
\
Look again at the \'93Army Circular\'94 of the 8th April 1876, as to the\
clothing of the men of the \'93Brigade Dep\'f4ts;\'94 it is evident that a man\
belongs neither to one \'93linked\'94 Battalion or to the other; he belongs\
to the \'93Brigade Dep\'f4t\'94 only, and has nothing to do with the traditions\
or honour of the Regiment in which he may be serving.\
\
Would-be Army reformers, of whom we have now far too many, say, \'93Oh,\
very few Regiments now have the Title of the county in which they were\
raised, so all this is of no importance;\'94 but they are not soldiers,\
so their opinion is valueless. Moreover, the assertion is only partly\
true, for it is nearly a century since most of the Regiments received\
the County Titles which they now bear.\
\
Would-be Army reformers are also responsible for the Appendix to \'93Army\
Circular\'94 of the 1st of December 1877, giving the War Establishment\
of a Battalion of Infantry, in which it is actually proposed to\
send a Regiment of boys eleven hundred strong into the field with\
twenty-three Company officers, whilst four officers of the Regiment are\
part of, and nearly useless at, the \'93Brigade Dep\'f4t.\'94\
\
We hear and we read everywhere that the Army is over-officered, but\
what is the opinion of an old soldier, as given in his lecture at the\
Royal United Service Institution on the 30th November 1877? He says:\
\
\'93How can you expect fire-discipline, from year-old peasant-soldiers,\
whose non-commissioned officers have little, if any, greater training\
than themselves, and with a field average of three and a half officers\
per company of two hundred men? For better or for worse, we have now an\
army of boys. Take the word of a man who has seen much fighting, both\
by trained and untrained soldiers. It behoves us, if we would escape\
disaster in the hour of trial, to take such means as will induce our\
non-commissioned officers to remain under the colours, and not go forth\
into civil, or quasi-civil life. And yet more incumbent is it on us to\
listen to no arguments of theory that would reduce the number of our\
commissioned officers. Our Army is so small that, more than any other,\
for the sake of judicious daring, and of judicious economy of life, it\
must be well, brilliantly, and carefully led. And this cannot be when\
sparse officers are whelmed in a confused mass of men.\'94\
\
What do the advocates of short service and \'93Brigade Dep\'f4ts\'94 say to this?\
\
From the foregoing remarks it will readily be perceived that the\
desire of the Compiler of this book is not to destroy, but to revive,\
_everything_ connected with every Regiment in the service, and,\
although omissions may be noted, it is hoped it contains no errors.\
\
There are many conflicting statements as to when Regiments were first\
numbered. Their _rank_ was first regulated by a board of General\
Officers assembled by King William the Third in the Netherlands, on the\
10th June 1694.\
\
Queen Anne assembled another board in 1713, to decide on the rank\
of Regiments raised subsequently to 1694, and King George the First\
assembled a third in 1715 for the same purpose.\
\
Cannon, in his \'93History of the Marine Corps,\'94 tells us, \'93These boards\
recommended that English Regiments raised in England should take rank\
from the date of their formation, and that English, Scots, and Irish\
Regiments raised for the service of a foreign power, should take rank\
from the date of their being placed on the English Establishment.\'94\
\
\'93The numerical Titles of Regiments, as fixed on the principles laid\
down in the Reports of the boards of General Officers above alluded\
to, were confirmed by the Warrant issued by authority of King George\
the Second, dated the 17th July 1761; and also by the Warrant of King\
George the Third, dated 19th December 1768; previously to which,\
Regiments were generally designated by the names of their Colonels.\'94\
\
The year 1751 has, therefore, been taken as the date on which the\
Regiments of the Army were first recognized officially by a number.\
\
The date of the raising of the different Regiments is given as that\
of the commission of its first Colonel, taken from the official\
\'93Succession of Colonels.\'94\
\
The greatest difficulty has been the compiling of the lists of\
Campaigns, &c. in which the various Regiments have borne a part.\
\
All those that appear on the Colours have been given, although many are\
of inferior importance to many that do not; moreover many Regiments\
have received distinctions for actions in which others shared who do\
not possess any record of the fact upon their Colours.\
\
The dates given are those in Haydn\'92s \'93Dictionary of Dates,\'94 which is\
assumed to be correct, and, in the case of a capture of a place, the\
_last_ day of the siege or capture is given.\
\
The thanks of the Compiler are due to those Adjutants and other\
officers of Regiments who have given him information, and also to T. D.\
Sullivan, Esq., late 56th Foot, Librarian of the Royal United Service\
Institution, for his assistance and help on many occasions.\

\
The Regiment was raised in Holland by King Charles II., and was at\
first composed of eighty gentlemen who had held commissions in the army\
of King Charles I.\
\
It wore cuirasses from its formation to 1698, and resumed them in 1821.\
\
It bears the Royal Arms as its crest.\
\
It is said the Regiments of Life Guards were at one time known as \'93the\
Cheeses,\'94 from the old gentlemen of the Life Guards declining to serve\
in them as remodelled in 1788, saying they were no longer composed of\
gentlemen, but of cheesemongers.\
\
The 3rd and 4th (Scots) Troops of Life Guards, disbanded in 1746, saw\
much service in the campaign of 1742\'9647, in Flanders.\

\
The first Second Troop of Life Guards consisted originally of a number\
of loyal gentlemen who had fought for King Charles I. After his murder\
they fled to the continent, and entered the Spanish service with the\
title of \'93His Royal Highness The Duke of York\'92s Troop of Guards.\'94 After\
the peace of 1659 they retired to the Netherlands till 1660, when King\
Charles II. made them the Second Troop of Life Guards. It became the\
Third Troop in 1670, and was disbanded in 1746.\
\
The Regiment has the same origin as the First Life Guards.\
\
It wore cuirasses from its formation to 1698, and resumed them in 1821.\
\
It bears the Royal Arms as its crest.\
\
It obtained its sea-green facings in honour of Queen Catherine, whose\
favourite colour it was. It is not known when the facings were changed,\
but it was between 1690 and 1742; its standard was changed from crimson\
to blue in 1758.\

\
This Regiment is the only Regiment of Cavalry now in existence that\
formed part of the Parliamentary Army during the reign of King Charles\
I., and was then known as Colonel Unton Crook\'92s. At the Restoration it\
was called \'93The Royal Regiment.\'94\
\
It wore cuirasses from its formation to 1698, and resumed them in 1821.\
\
It bears the Royal Arms as its crest.\
\

from a Dutch Regiment of Horse Guards dressed in Blue commanded by the\
Earl of Portland, this Regiment being commanded by the Earl of Oxford.\
It was also known as the \'93Blue Guards\'94 during the campaign in Flanders\
1742\'9645, and is now commonly called \'93The Blues.\'94\
\
It was presented by King William IV. with a Standard emblazoned with\

The Regiment was in the service of Sweden from 1625 to 1633, and in\
that of France from 1633 to 1678, except in 1661, 1667, and 1668.\
\
Tradition asserts that it was originally the Body-Guard of the Scottish\
Kings.\
\
It bore, in 1633, St. Andrew\'92s Cross, with Thistle and Crown; and, in\
1751, the distinction of the Colours of 2nd Battalion was a flaming ray\
of gold from the upper corner of each Colour to the centre.\
\
It bears the Royal Cypher within the Collar of St. Andrew, and the\
Crown over it; also the Thistle and Crown, with the motto of the Order,\
\'93Nemo me impune lacessit.\'94\
\
It captured a Colour from the Moors at the defence of Tanjier, in 1680,\
for which it received its title in 1684; it also captured the Duke of\
Monmouth\'92s Standard at the Battle of Sedgmoor, 1685.\
\
It is nicknamed \'93Pontius Pilate\'92s Body Guard,\'94 from its antiquity.\

\
The Regiment was raised in England to garrison Tanjier, part of the\
dowry of Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II.; but it\
was partly formed at Tanjier from the Duke of Gloucester\'92s, Earl of\
Bristol\'92s, Lord Newborough\'92s, and Colonel Green\'92s Regiments in the\
Spanish service.\
\
It received on its formation the Badge of the \'93Paschal Lamb,\'94 the\
crest of the House of Braganza, and Sea-green facings, that being the\
favourite colour of Queen Catherine.\
\
It bears the Royal Cypher within the Garter, and Crown over it; and the\
\'93Paschal Lamb\'94 with the mottoes \'93_Pristin\'e6 virtutis memor_\'94 and\
\'93_Vel exuvi\'e6 triumphant_\'94; also \'93the Sphinx\'94 for Egypt, 1801.\
\
It received its title and first motto in 1703 for its gallant conduct\
at Tongres, 1703.\
\
It is said to have been called \'93the Governor\'92s Regiment\'94 at its\
formation.\
\
It was nicknamed \'93Kirke\'92s Lambs,\'94 from its Badge and Colonel from 1682\
to 1691; also \'93the Sleepy Queen\'92s,\'94 from its carelessness at Almeida in\
allowing General Brennier to escape.\

\
The Regiment had been in the service of Holland from the time of\
Queen Elizabeth, and so retained its title on being taken on the\
establishment of the British Army.\
\
It bore in 1686 the Red Cross of St. George bordered with white on a\
green ground.\
\
It received its badge of \'93the Dragon\'94 for its gallant conduct on all\
occasions, and as indicating the origin of the Regiment in the reign of\
Queen Elizabeth.\
\
It also bears the Rose and Crown.\
\
It captured eleven guns and a Standard at the Battle of Punniar.\
\
It was nicknamed \'93the Buff Howards,\'94 from its facings and Colonel from\
1737 to 1749; also \'93the Nut-crackers\'94; and \'93the Resurrectionists,\'94\
from its reappearing at the Battle of Albuera after being dispersed\
by the Polish Lancers; also \'93the Old Buffs\'94 from its facings, and to\
distinguish it from the 31st, \'93the Young Buffs;\'94 but the most ancient\
\'93Old Buffs\'94 was the \'93Duke of York and Albany\'92s Maritime Regiment,\'94\
raised in 1664, that was incorporated into the 2nd or Coldstream Guards\
in 1689.\

Regiment), \'93the Rose and Crown,\'94 \'93the King\'92s Crest,\'94 and the motto \'93Quo\
fata vocant.\'94\
\
It is not known when the facings were changed to Green. The peculiar\
shade now worn is said to have been first adopted in consequence of the\
colour fading.\
\
It was permitted to wear Fuzileer caps in commemoration of its\
defeating a French Division of Grenadiers at the battle of\
Wilhelmstahl, 1762; and also a white plume in the cap for its gallantry\
at St. Lucia in 1778, with the Grenadier and Light Battalions which\
formed \'93the Reserve.\'94 These troops plucked the white feathers from the\
hats of the dead French, and decorated their own with them. The 5th is\
the only Regiment that has retained the distinction by now wearing a\
red and white pompon.\
\
It received its title in 1782 in compliment to its Colonel, Earl Percy.\
\
It was nicknamed in 1764 \'93the Shiners\'94 from its clean and smart\
appearance; and in the Peninsula \'93the Old Bold Fifth,\'94 \'93the Fighting\

It was allowed to wear a red plume in the hat, for the conduct of its\
Light Company in 1777, which with five others of different Regiments\
composed \'93The Light Battalion\'94 which made itself so obnoxious to the\
Americans, that they said they would give it no quarter; to prevent\
mistakes, the Light Battalion dyed their feathers red. The Regiment is\
the only one that has retained this distinction.\
\
It was nicknamed \'93Murray\'92s Bucks\'94 from its Colonel\'92s name 1743 to 1764;\

Brigade in September 1777; also \'93The Lacedemonians\'94 from its Colonel\

crimson wearing so badly; the Colonel then wished to have Blue, but\
this not being allowed, he took purple, the favourite colour of Madame\
de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV. of France; from which it was\
nicknamed \'93The Pompadours\'94; and also \'93The Saucy Pompeys.\'94\

Sharpshooters\'94 from its Colonel\'92s name, and its being armed with rifles.\
\
It bore a \'93Bugle Horn\'94 before the badge of \'93The Maltese Cross\'94 was\
adopted, which probably took place when the names of victories were\
first granted. It was at first surmounted with a figure of \'93Fame.\'94 The\
Cross was surmounted by a Crown about 1830.\
\
It ranks next to the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders.\

Crown,\'94 \'93The Anchor and Laurel\'94 for its services at Belle Isle in 1761,\
and \'93The Royal Cypher.\'94\
\
It received its Title in 1802, in commemoration of its services during\
the late war.\

Highness The Duke of York and Albany\'92s Maritime Regiment,\'94 raised in\
1664. Its uniform was Yellow with Scarlet facings. It was incorporated\
into the present Coldstream Guards in 1689.\
\
Six Marine Regiments were raised in 1702, three were disbanded in\
1713, and the others are the present 30th Cambridgeshire, the 31st\
Huntingdonshire, and the 32nd Cornwall Light Infantry.\
\
The present 6th Royal First Warwickshire, 19th Princess of Wales\'92s Own,\
20th East Devonshire, 34th Cumberland, 35th Royal Sussex, and 36th\
Herefordshire, were placed on the Marine Establishment for sea service\
in 1702, and served as Marines for some years.\
\
In 1739 six Regiments of Marines were formed, and four more in 1740;\
their facings were as follows:-- 1st Regiment, Yellow; 2nd, Green; 3rd,\
Yellow; 4th, White; 5th, Yellow; 6th, Green; 7th, White; 8th, Yellow;\
9th, Buff; 10th, Yellow. They were all disbanded in 1748.\

By this Chart, any person, however ignorant of the subject, may, by\
an hour\'92s attention, obtain a clear view of the broad lines of Indian\
History, and of the evolutions which have resulted in the dominion\
of Her Majesty as EMPRESS OF INDIA. It will be found invaluable for\
EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, especially in Colleges and Schools,\
where an Indian career is in contemplation. It will also be found of\
PERMANENT UTILITY in all Libraries and Offices as a work\
of ready reference for the connection of events and dates. Besides\
the History of India, it includes the contemporaneous histories of\
AFGHANISTAN, CENTRAL ASIA, and EUROPE.\

                        A RELIEVO MAP OF INDIA.\

                                  BY\
\
                            HENRY F. BRION.\

\
\
A map of this kind brings before us such a picture of the surface of\
a given country as no ordinary map could ever do. To the mind\'92s eye\
of the average Englishman, India consists of \'91the plains\'92 and \'91the\
hills,\'92 chiefly of the former, the hills being limited to the Himalayas\
and the Nilgiris. The new map will at least enable him to correct his\
notions of Indian geography. It combines the usual features of a good\
plain map of the country on a scale of 150 miles to the inch, with\
a faithful representation of all the uneven surfaces, modelled on a\
scale thirty-two times the horizontal one; thus bringing out into clear\
relief the comparative heights and outlines of all the hill-ranges,\
and showing broad tracts of uneven ground, of intermingled hill and\
valley, which a common map of the same size would hardly indicate,\
except to a very practised eye. The plains of Upper India are reduced\
to their true proportions; the Central Provinces, Malwa, and Western\
Bengal reveal their actual ruggedness at a glance; and Southern India,\
from the Vindhyas to Cape Comorin, proclaims its real height above\
the sea-level. To the historical as well as the geographical student\
such a map is an obvious and important aid in tracing the course of\
past campaigns, in realising the conditions under which successive\
races carried their arms or settlements through the Peninsula, and\
in comprehending the difference of race, climate, and physical\
surroundings which make up our Indian Empire. Set in a neat frame of\
maplewood, the map seems to attract the eye like a prettily-coloured\
picture, and its price, a guinea, should place it within the reach\
of all who care to combine the useful with the ornamental.\'93--_Home\

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the\
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not\
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,\
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as\
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope\
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting\
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm\
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the\
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily\
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the\

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,\
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any\
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no\

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:\
\
  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no\

  you are located before using this eBook.\
\
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is\
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not\
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the\
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in\
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are\
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project\

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all\
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue\
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm\

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of\
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set\

1.F.\
\
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project\
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm\
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may\
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate\
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or\
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or\
cannot be read by your equipment.\
\
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you\
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium\

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\
from people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\
www.gutenberg.org\

\
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\
\
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\
volunteer support.\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\
edition.\
\
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search\
facility: www.gutenberg.org\
\
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\
